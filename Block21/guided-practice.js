//1. Create a JavaScript class of Home. Include the following:

// A construct that accepts rooms, bathrooms, and squareFeet
// A method that uses the `this` keyword to return the number of rooms, bathrooms, and how many square feet


class Home {
    constructor(rooms, bathrooms, squareFeet) {
        this.rooms = rooms
        this.bathrooms = bathrooms
        this.squareFeet = squareFeet
    }

    getInfo() {
        return `This home as ${this.rooms} rooms, ${this.bathroms} bathrooms, and is ${this.squareFeet} square feet.`;
    }
}

//2. Create a SingleFamilyHome subclass. Include all of the Home parameters plus yardSize. 

class SingleFamilyHome extends Home {
    constructor(rooms, bathrooms, squareFeet, yardSize) {
      super(rooms, bathrooms, squareFeet);
      this.yardSize = yardSize;
    }
  
    getInfo() {
      return `${super.getInfo()} It has a ${this.yardSize} square foot yard.`;
    }
  }
  
//3. Create an Apartment subclass. Include all of the Home parameters plus which floor the unit is on.

class Apartment extends Home {
    constructor(rooms, bathrooms, squareFeet, floor) {
      super(rooms, bathrooms, squareFeet);
      this.floor = floor;
    }
  
    getInfo() {
      return `${super.getInfo()} It is on floor ${this.floor}.`;
    }
  }
